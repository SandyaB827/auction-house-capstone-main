## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Start the application: `dotnet run` from TheAuctionHouse directory
2. Access Swagger UI at: `http://localhost:5000`
3. Use admin credentials: `admin@auctionhouse.com` / `Admin123!`

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Authentication Setup
```json
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "admin@auctionhouse.com",
  "password": "Admin123!"
}
```
- Copy the JWT token from response
- Click "Authorize" in Swagger UI and enter: `Bearer {your-token}`

#### 2. Setup Test Data (Optional - for richer dashboard)
Create some test data to see the dashboard in action:

```json
// Create assets
POST /api/assets
{
  "title": "Vintage Guitar Collection",
  "description": "A beautiful collection of vintage guitars from the 1960s",
  "retailValue": 5000
}

POST /api/assets
{
  "title": "Antique Watch",
  "description": "Rare antique pocket watch from 1920s",
  "retailValue": 2500
}

// Add wallet funds
POST /api/wallet/deposit
{
  "amount": 10000
}

// Change asset status and create auctions
PATCH /api/assets/1/status
{
  "status": "OpenToAuction"
}

POST /api/auctions
{
  "assetId": 1,
  "reservedPrice": 1000,
  "minimumBidIncrement": 100,
  "totalMinutesToExpiry": 120
}
```

#### 3. Get Comprehensive Dashboard
```json
GET /api/dashboard
```

**Expected Results:**
- **UserSummary**: User profile with roles and membership info
- **WalletSummary**: Complete wallet overview with transaction totals
  - Current balance and blocked amounts
  - Total deposited, withdrawn, spent, and earned
  - Transaction count
- **AuctionsSummary**: Complete auction activity overview
  - Total auctions created and their status
  - Bidding activity and success metrics
  - Financial performance (earned from sales, spent on purchases)
- **AssetsSummary**: Asset portfolio overview
  - Total assets owned by status
  - Total and average retail value
- **ActiveAuctions**: Top 5 active auctions with user context
  - User's bids prioritized
  - Complete auction details with remaining time
- **UserActiveBids**: User's current active bids
  - Real-time status (highest bidder or outbid)
  - Auction expiry information
- **RecentActivity**: Activity feed with visual indicators
  - Wallet transactions, bids, auction creation
  - Icons and colors for UI representation

#### 4. Get Active Auctions for Dashboard
```json
GET /api/dashboard/active-auctions?limit=10&sortBy=expiry
```

**Expected Results:**
- List of active auctions with user context
- Smart sorting options:
  - `expiry`: User's bids first, then by nearest expiry
  - `bid`: User's bids first, then by highest bid
  - `created`: Most recently created first
- Each auction includes:
  - Complete asset and seller information
  - Current bid status and next call price
  - User's relationship (seller, highest bidder, can bid)
  - Remaining time and total bid count

**Sorting Tests:**
```json
// Test different sorting options
GET /api/dashboard/active-auctions?sortBy=bid&limit=5
GET /api/dashboard/active-auctions?sortBy=created&limit=15
GET /api/dashboard/active-auctions?sortBy=expiry&limit=20
```

#### 5. Get User's Active Bids
```json
GET /api/dashboard/my-active-bids?limit=10
```

**Expected Results:**
- List of user's active bids on live auctions
- For each bid:
  - User's bid amount vs current highest bid
  - Whether user is currently the highest bidder
  - Auction expiry and remaining time
  - Next call price for outbid scenarios
  - Seller information

#### 6. Get Statistics
```json
GET /api/dashboard/stats
```

**Expected Results:**
- **UserStats**: Individual performance metrics
  - User rank based on transaction volume
  - Total auctions created and bids placed
  - Auctions won and success rate
  - Total transaction volume
- **PlatformStats** (Admin only): System-wide analytics
  - Total users, auctions, and assets
  - Transaction volume and average auction value
  - Platform success rate and total bids

**Admin vs User Test:**
- Login as admin: Should see both UserStats and PlatformStats
- Login as regular user: Should see only UserStats

#### 7. Get Recent Activity
```json
GET /api/dashboard/recent-activity?limit=20
```

**Expected Results:**
- Chronologically ordered activity feed
- Activity types include:
  - Wallet transactions (Deposit, Withdrawal, BidBlocked, BidReleased, PaymentMade, PaymentReceived)
  - Auction activities (BidPlaced, AuctionCreated)
- Each activity includes:
  - Type, description, and timestamp
  - Amount (for financial activities)
